## Story
We sometimes go to a sushi restaurant where you can order food with your smartphone. But the frontend has some issues, for example slow image loading (and no caching!), no way of tracking of what your client ordered (there is just a order history per table) and some other little quirks. So we decided to write our own app which improved on all of these points!

### Important Note
This Organization is in no way affiliated with the actual restaurants. This is just a Proof of Concept as of now.
